## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(This is a simple program designed to create pixel art. There is one function to draw one or more pixels in a horizontal row of a certain color, and another to move the turtle to the next row at a certain x position. The program also keeps track of the number of pixels drawn.)*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(Everything works well to my knowledge)*
