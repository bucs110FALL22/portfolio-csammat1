## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(This was the only two APIs I could get working. My initial idea was to convert to price of steam games on sale, but the steam sale API would not work. I then tried a few other ideas before ending on this one. I did not realize to after I had finished that the crypto API had options to convert the price, but that was not used, and the Currency API I used has more options for converting. I use a try and except function to keep to program running until it completes 1 successful convertion.)*
